# Task-6-Password-Strength-Evaluation

## Objective:
Test passwords of different complexities using an online evaluation tool and document their strength scores.

## Tool Used:
- [https://www.passwordmeter.com](https://www.passwordmeter.com)

## Process:
1. Tested 3 sample passwords:
   - `password` (weak)
   - `alpha@54` (good)
   - `D9s#G1!nV@82KZp` (very strong)
2. Analyzed score and feedback for each password
3. Took screenshots of each result
4. Documented the differences in structure and complexity

## Files:
- `password_test_results.md`
- `screenshot_weak_password.png`
- `screenshot_good_password.png`
- `screenshot_strong_password.png`

## What I Learned:
- Longer and more random passwords significantly increase strength
- Including numbers, symbols, and uppercase letters improves complexity
- Avoiding dictionary words and patterns is critical for secure passwords
- Strong passwords are a key defense against brute-force and dictionary attacks

## Conclusion:
Password strength is not just about length â€” structure and randomness matter. Tools like password managers can help generate and store secure credentials.
